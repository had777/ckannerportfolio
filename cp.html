   <div id = "tptext" > The Poughkeepsie City School District, established in 1843, initially served exclusively white students, later creating a separate school for Black children in 1844 (Butler, 2023). There are no records of Black students attending Poughkeepsie High School before 1870. Both Vassar College and Eastman Business College did not admit Black students in the 1860s (Miscellany News, 1997).
    Pressure from Black advocacy groups prompted the New York State legislature to abolish segregation in public education in 1874, leading to the desegregation of Poughkeepsie schools by 1875 (Mamiya & Roberts, 1986). Beginning in the 1950s, the white population of Poughkeepsie city decreased as the area became more racially or ethnoculturally diverse. This mass exodus of white people caused demographic shifts, decreasing the City of Poughkeepsie's white population from 96% in 1950 to 74% in 1980. Meanwhile, People of Color faced barriers due to housing discrimination (Flad & Griffen, 2009). The repercussions of elementary school segregation, unequal neighborhood development, and ongoing white flight to suburban areas (Flad & Griffen, 2009) are still seen in Poughkeepsie schools such as Clinton Elementary.
    Across the street from a small park in the heart of Poughkeepsie is Governor Clinton Elementary School, a tremendous brick building with a sign in front that flashes, “Excellence is our goal.”Students' voices ring through the hallways as they recite the school mission statement each morning following the pledge of allegiance. My students, with their hands still resting over their hearts, chant, “The Clinton Cougar community commits to provide a safe and healthy environment in which everyone can achieve excellence.” The teachers of Clinton are dedicated to bringing this mission statement to fruition.
    As of 2022, Clinton Elementary houses 261 students ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade. The majority, at 57%, of students walking through the newly repainted hallways are Black, while 30% identify as Hispanic, 17% as mixed race, and 6% as white (NYSED, 2023). I spent my time teaching fourth grade on the third floor with students who are persistent and curious learners. When my students were in 3rd grade the previous year, there were three classrooms which students were divided into. These classrooms had a 16:1 student to teacher ratio. When students enter 4th grade the previous three classes are combined to make only two classes. Due to the larger student to teacher ratio in fourth grade, guaranteeing that students get individualized attention is a persistent challenge.
    Categorized as a Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI) school, Clinton Elementary experiences pressure to improve on their New York standardized testing scores (NYSED, 2023). These high-stakes tests are a large part of determining the school funding levels. In a faculty meeting, Clinton Elementary’s principal discussed the need for Clinton to improve its test scores to receive more federal funding. This pressure trickles down through the curriculum to the students. During my time at Clinton, my students take anywhere between 4 and 7 tests a week which seems to exacerbate their test anxiety. One of my students in particular has come to me in tears because they were so worried about failing their unit test. The school’s mandated curriculum, which focuses on elevating test scores, leaves little space for teachers to infuse their own or their students’ passions and interests into the lessons being taught. Due to the lack of
    
     culturally responsive teaching, my students often find it difficult to find meaning in what they’re learning. Much of the school day is spent refocusing student’s attention towards these standardized texts.
    The state of the school building itself is also a barrier to student learning and wellbeing. The district is burdened by failing boiler systems, aging structures, rodents and mold in the middle school and elementary schools and more. At Clinton Elementary, issues with heat and cooling in the building lead to scorching or frigid learning environments, where students are distracted by trying to keep warm and understandably struggle to focus. For the first weeks of the school term, the classroom temperature consistently hovered in the 90s without the presence of an air conditioning system. During discussions about potential classroom improvements, a notable majority of the students—exceeding fifty percent—expressed they wanted a functional air conditioning unit. Though the bathrooms were newly renovated, which was needed, there are no working water fountains on the first floor (Schutzman, 2018). How can students feel respected and cared for when they can not get water on their floor or the floors are cracking? We need to take this problem seriously, and advocate for structurally sound and safe schools for all.
    The community at Clinton Elementary is tight knit and strong. Students call each other “cousins” and families spend time together outside of school. Due to parents working multiple jobs or shifts that are incompatible with school pick up times, many of my student’s parents help take care of other’s children. Most of my student’s parents work in public service as bus drivers, police officers, and sanitation workers. Their demanding schedules make it difficult to come to school events and parent teacher conferences. I often engage with parents via Classdojo, a communication service between teachers and parents. If a student had a great day or a particular challenge I inform their parents by individual messaging on Classdojo. This platform is also where weekly newsletters are sent. Though we have the ability to message parents, not all respond to the messages. During parent teacher conferences 13 of my student’s parents came to their set times, while the other 7 families did not come to their set time.
    Schools are more than just educational institutions. They also serve as pillars for communities — strengthening civic life, and attracting families and jobs. Clinton Elementary school may have its faults, but students and teachers alike try their best to “achieve excellence” as is the school's mission statement.
