   <div id = "tptext" > Every school morning, I welcome my students at the door, holding their attendance slips.
    Their vibrant energy fills the room as they share snippets from the previous day or inquire about
    gym class or if they can assist with the word of the day. While they eat breakfast and place their
    homework in the tray, we collectively note any new idioms encountered in our readings and
    introduce our new word or phrase for the day. From Monday to Thursday, I share Spanish
    phrases, and on Fridays, one or two students share a word or phrase in any language with me and
    their peers. This serves as a means to integrate elements of my students' lives and my own into
    our classroom.

    Within the school's curriculum, there's limited room to incorporate my or my students'
    identities and interests into our learning. Often, the readings from our workbook are met with
    groans, as my students do not feel represented in these texts. By sharing words and languages
    that hold significance for my students, my cooperating teacher and I strive to become more
    culturally responsive while fulfilling our obligations.
    Regarding my decision to teach my students Spanish, I am not Latina, but I grew up
    speaking Spanish every day with my godmother (who is from Guatemala) and my mother (who
    learned Spanish in high school and college). Three of my students speak Spanish at home and
    assist me in teaching their classmates in the mornings. This allows me to share a part of myself
    with my students and enables them to communicate with peers who speak Spanish as their first
    language within the building.
    <br>

    On Fridays, my students help to teach a word in a language they are familiar with. They
    take on the role of teaching their classmates while I provide support. This is a way for students to
    share their own knowledge. They present the phrase, we repeat it as a class, and they explain its
    usage and why they chose that particular word or phrase to share with us. Several of my students
    have family in Jamaica or have immigrated from Jamaica and speak Patois at home. Often my
    students chose to teach patois phrases to our class.
    Throughout the school day, my students and especially myself often forget to continue
    using the phrases or words we learned in the morning. Due to our demanding schedule, there are
    also days when we are unable to cover the word or phrase of the day. Having a running list
    posted in the classroom might help remind us to use the phrases we learn. I hope to continue this
    practice in my own classroom. Making space for multiple cultures and languages in the
    classroom is essential to creating a community where students feel comfortable and welcome
