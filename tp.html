            <p>When I think about school, many ideas come to mind: grades, community, core curriculum, competition, and learning. Though I have had a mostly positive school experience, that is not the case for many students, including the many I have worked with at Clinton Elementary School. The school system that we live with is not easy or fair, especially if you do not have the privilege of being a wealthy, white individual. This system is failing children by not being culturally relevant or a place where they feel comfortable learning. As an educator, it's my belief and obligation to instill in our students the ability to be conscientious citizens who are vocal about reevaluating society. Empowering students to form their identity and purpose will, in good faith, give them the freedom to promote societal change. To develop these reasoning skills, students require the right kind of environment and support from schools, teachers, and parents. It is also necessary for them to challenge, discuss, and even argue about what they are learning. How can a student want to listen to their teacher if they do not understand why they are learning what they are learning, or how it relates to their experiences? To create an education system that creates productive members of society, who can change the status quo, we must build a new structure from the ground up that promotes critical thinking, student involvement in curricular decision making, vulnerability and active listening.</p>
            <br>
        </br>

  <p>To create active members of society we must start with personal reflection. As an educator and community member, I am obligated to understand how I show up in the world. Where do I have privilege that my students do not? How do my actions and words affect others in my community? These are a few of the questions I ask myself often. I hope to share this kind of thinking with my students. With a strong sense of identity, students are better able to focus on what matters to them and better prepared for personal and academic growth. What’s more, identity work is a powerful way to address historic inequities in education and support students in finding a sense of belonging. It is necessary to spend time learning how identities overlap with one another and affect how we are perceived in society. The classroom is a shared space where our own thoughts, feelings, and personal knowledge interact with one another. To effectively be in the classroom, students must have a mutual understanding of how their peers' identities affect their decision making and points of view.</p>
  <br>

  <p>For some students and their parents, school has been a place where they feel punished and/or unfulfilled. Therefore, a sense of belonging, safety, and support in school is critically important for learning. An environment where the student is supported by both the teacher and their peers enhances all the relationships in the classroom. It is also a strong antidote to intolerance, indifference, and prejudice. This type of environment can be created from the first day of school by teachers having conversations about the expectations and interests of the class. By gauging students' backgrounds and interests, a teacher (if there is time and resources) should cater their teaching toward their specific students. Educators should hopefully also instill in students’ minds that they all can succeed. In <i>The Dreamkeepers: Successful Teachers of African American Children</i>, a book by Gloria Ladson-Billings, she writes, “Culturally relevant teaching methods do not suggest to students that they are incapable of learning. [T]eachers provide intellectual challenges by teaching to the highest standards and not to the lowest common denominator” (Ladson-Billings, 123). Expectations, with encouragement, will help students feel that they are being supported in their efforts. Choosing a curriculum that reflects the plethora of cultures and contexts of students allows disenfranchised or marginalized groups to see their importance through an academic lens. Being able to share personal experiences as part of the learning process fosters vulnerability, active listening, and community. Being vulnerable in the classroom promotes humility and deeper thinking, strengthens relationships with peers, and prompts more authentic responses. Teachers, as well as students, showing that they are not perfect helps them understand that it's natural to have flaws and make mistakes which they can learn from.</p>

  <p>Curriculum is supposedly constructed with the learner as its central focus. Yet the voice of the learner is largely excluded from the curriculum design and implementation process. I believe that student involvement in the curriculum planning process is a means of making them active learners. Students should be given a voice in curriculum planning and decision making. One way of implementing this would be getting student input on what books to read in class or having student-led conferences or giving students the choice of multiple styles of assessments which they can choose from. If they are involved, students will feel a sense of ownership over what they will learn and can be accountable thereafter. As well, a curriculum which equips students for the challenging world of the twenty-first century needs to ensure they are supported to take increasing responsibility for their own learning, their physical, personal and social well being, their relationships with others and their role in the local, national and global community. As students progress through school, they need to be encouraged to take greater responsibility for their own learning and participation. This involves developing as individual learners who are able to set goals for themselves and use the resources at their disposal. Being involved in the curriculum making process leads to students enhancing both teaching and learning; improving teacher-student relationships; increasing student engagement; and raising student self-esteem and efficacy, as they put care and interest into their own curriculum.</p>

  <p>I believe that our education system must prioritize inclusivity, student involvement, and exploration of identity. Introducing these practices would revolutionize the American education system, which would in turn, benefit society as a whole. Recognizing the link between education and political consciousness is necessary to any action that seeks to dismantle oppression and promote critical thinking. As radical Brazilian educator and theorist Paulo Freire discusses to be a revolutionary, one must be a teacher and student of and for the community.</p>
