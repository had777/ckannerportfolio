    <p>Being in a classroom means having around 25 people sharing a space together for more than 6 hours a day—and none of us have chosen to be here except for me. We are all very different; we come from different families, we have different values, and we have different needs—and here we are all pushed together into one room for the next nine months. Classroom management means learning how to share this space together, learning how to share resources and how to make room for the different kinds of knowledge we have. How to be together in ways that support and uplift each other. This means having to do the hard work of becoming a collective of people/learners that show unconditional care and love for each person in our community. Showing care for our space and the people that inhabit it is a curriculum as important as any other that we engage in.</p>

    <p>On Physical Space: Discussions of organization and management often neglect the physical characteristics of the classroom. Yet the classroom setting can influence the way students feel, think, and behave. The Reggio Emilia Approach, pioneered by Loris Malaguzzi, insists that the built environment is a teacher – the third teacher. Meaning, the environment will reflect what students and teachers are interested in, focused on, and learning about. I want to implement this philosophy in my classroom. My goal is to create a classroom environment which encourages communication and builds strong relationships and a healthy classroom community. One way I can work toward this goal is by leaving space on the walls for students’ work and having a place dedicated to family photos. Though students will be spending their year in my classroom, I want the room to feel like ours. I want to create spaces where students can self regulate their emotions and feel safe, like a “cool down corner”. By implementing these procedures, I hope students will feel like we’ve made our classroom together and that they can see themselves in it.</p>
    <br>

    <p>On Student-Teacher relationship: As a classroom teacher I know I don’t have the power to change entire systems, but I can transform the classroom experience into one that builds lasting, loving, and trusting relationships. Radical educator and feminist thinker bell hooks maintains that the classroom should be “a place that is life-sustaining and mind-expanding, a place of liberating mutuality where teacher and student together work in partnership” (hooks, 2003). To create a “partnership” there must be mutual respect between student and teacher. Brazilian educator Paulo Friere emphasizes the reduction of teacher-student hierarchies and aiming for classroom dialogue rather than monologic lectures. Like hooks, I agree with parts of Friere’s pedagogy and yet learner-centered models can be counterproductive since they help to veil existing power structures. One way of implementing my beliefs is by making a collaborative list of community norms. In many of my education classes at Vassar College, on the first day of class, my professors invited us to share what other teachers had done that we liked and wanted to implement in this class or what we felt was necessary to acknowledge when making a classroom community.</p>

    <p> On Routines: I, and many other educators, want to break away from the routines and models of classroom management that I grew up with where one person is setting rules,
    procedures, and interventions for everyone, immediately squash unpleasant behavior or conflict. Instead of stopping conflict, I was inspired by Carla Shalaby’s Troublemakers: Lessons in Freedom from Young Children at School (The New Press, 2017) to embrace and question conflict. As she often expresses that, “community conflict” is an integral part of growing and learning. I want to have healthy community conflict that is well-supported, well-scaffolded, and is worked through in a manner that is democratic and continues to build our community. This might look like having morning meetings and closing circles where we discuss how we are feeling about the spaces we inhabit, inside and outside of the classroom. I want there to be space for messiness and gray areas which might be learning how to agree to disagree. I want to be an educator who is well-prepared to facilitate a process of young people working together to heal and solve problems in ways that we would want replicated in the world beyond classrooms.</p>

    <p>While spending time at Warring Elementary, we met with a pair of fourth grade co-teachers. We discussed what the start of the year looked like for them and the importance of classroom management. They spoke about how their administration was disappointed in how behind they were with teaching the curriculum. These teachers expressed that, why they were behind was due to them building a strong classroom community. I could not agree with them more that classroom management is not a distraction or something that's stopping us from getting to the curriculum; it in itself is a curriculum as integral to learning as academics.</p>
